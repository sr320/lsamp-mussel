### Project goals
Evaluate the genetic response of *Mytilus trossulus* to acute temperature shock. 

### Timeline
1. **07/05/2022** - 50 mussels collected from Shilsole Bay Marina, WA (47°41'15.5"N 122°24'13.7"W). Brought into lab, cleaned, and labeled. Held at 11C in recirculating tank. Fed estimated 5% body weight per day algal paste (Shellfish Diet 1800). <br/>
2. **07/06/2022** - Shell measurments taken (length, height, width - nearest mm) <br/>
3. **07/12/2022** - Start of temperature experiment. T1-15, T36-40: heated (25C, static, rapid ramp); T15-30, T31-35: control (11C). <br/>
4. **07/13/2022** - End of temperature treatment (24h). Gill, mantle, and foot tisuee collected and flash forzen from T1-30. Somatic and gonad tissue seperated from T31-40 and dried in 55C oven for calculation of condition (CI) and gonad index (GI). <br/>
